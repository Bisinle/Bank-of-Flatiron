The React Todo App is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do list. It demonstrates the usage of four components: App, TodoList, TodoItem, and AddTodo.

Transaction Tracker App
The Transaction Tracker App is a web application that allows users to manage their transactions effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can view a table of all transactions, add new transactions, and filter transactions based on description. Additionally, the app offers bonus features like sorting transactions alphabetically and deleting transactions from the table.

Components Overview

1. App
   The App component is the root component of the Todo App. It manages the state of the entire application, including the list of todos. It also contains the TodoList component for displaying the list of todos and the AddTodo component for adding new todos.

2. TodoList
   The TodoList component receives an array of todos as props from the App component and renders a list of TodoItem components. It also handles the logic for filtering and sorting the list of todos.

3. TodoItem
   The TodoItem component represents an individual todo item in the list. It receives the todo data as props from the TodoList component and displays the todo's text and completion status. It also provides a checkbox to mark the todo as completed and a delete button to remove the todo from the list.

4. AddTodo
   The AddTodo component is responsible for adding new todos to the list. It contains a form with an input field where users can type their new todo and a submit button to add it to the list. The new todo is then passed back to the App component to update the state.
